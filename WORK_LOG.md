Thinking about ways to store the data, I think hashing is definitely going to be involved somehow. |

I'm a little confused how to set the hashmap up with the extra arraylists. |

| November 4 |   7:15-8pm   | Worked a BUNCH on the HashMap class and methods, I thought I had gotten it pretty much right but then ran a teat and got a null point exception in my hash method. not sure what I'm doing wrong but my best guess is that something is wrong with the add method and if the data is actually getting added in when I'm reading in the file. will keep debugging tonight if I have time, but otherwise in class tomorrow. |
| November 4 | 9:45-10:15pm |                        took another look and realized I just forgot to do the actual linear probing part of my add method, so i added that in which kinda fixed my problem, but now i'm getting a null pointer in my hash method so idk whats going on anymore. I think my idea of storing the values and keys in different arrays could be causing problems. will take another look and get some help in class tomorrow! |
