|:-----------|:----------:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| October 25 |  2.15-3pm  |        brainstormed a lot. Thinking about ways to store the data, I think hashing is definitely going to be involved somehow. |
| October 29 |   9-10pm   |                                                                          did more brainstorming, wrote code to read the file. |
| October 30 | 12:45-1:45 | Wrote more methods, talked about possible ways to solve with arraylists. I'm kinda of confused how to set the whole thing up. |
| October 31 |  10-10:30  |                                                        worked on the insert method, but confused how to set up the arraylist? |
| November 1 |  9:30-10   |                             still confused, i don't even know what to do. I thought we had tutorial today but apparently not. |
