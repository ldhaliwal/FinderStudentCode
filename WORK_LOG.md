Thinking about ways to store the data, I think hashing is definitely going to be involved somehow. |

I'm a little confused how to set the hashmap up with the extra arraylists. |

| November 4 |  7:15-8pm  | Worked a BUNCH on the HashMap class and methods, I thought I had gotten it pretty much right but then ran a teat and got a null point exception in my hash method. not sure what I'm doing wrong but my best guess is that something is wrong with the add method and if the data is actually getting added in when I'm reading in the file. will keep debugging tonight if I have time, but otherwise in class tomorrow. |
