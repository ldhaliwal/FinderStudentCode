Thinking about ways to store the data, I think hashing is definitely going to be involved somehow. |

I'm a little confused how to set the hashmap up with the extra arraylists. |

I think my idea of storing the values and keys in different arrays could be causing problems. will take another look and get some help in class tomorrow! |
| November 5 |  9-9:55 am   | Made a ton of progress, fixed the null pointer exceptions (the pair hadn't yet been initialized) and fixed a few more null pointer errors that came up along the way. I had also forgotten to do the moving to the next index stuff in my getter method, so I implemented that. Everything runs correctly, but the product check times out. I tried a few different numbers for my initial table size, and also got rid of my check size method (just copied the code into my add method to get rid of an extra method call, idk if it made a huge difference) but the runtime is still a bit too long. It's well under 4 seconds when my computer is plugged in, but I would love to find a way to reduce the runtime regularly. |
