| October 25 |  2.15-3pm  |                              brainstormed a lot. Thinking about ways to store the data, I think hashing is definitely going to be involved somehow. |
| October 29 |   9-10pm   |                                                                                                did more brainstorming, wrote code to read the file. |
| October 30 | 12:45-1:45 | Wrote more methods, talked about possible ways to solve with arraylists. I'm a little confused how to set the hashmap up with the extra arraylists. |
| October 31 |  10-10:30  |                                                       worked on the insert method, was really rushed and too tired to make any significant progress |
| November 1 | 9:30-9:45  |                                                                                                                              Finished insert method |
